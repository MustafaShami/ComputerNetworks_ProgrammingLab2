 TO RUN PROGRAM IN TERMINAL (Example)
      1.  'make clean'   -> command to remove old executable
      2.  'make'         -> to create new executable
      3.  './mylinkstate input.txt 7 0'   -> parameters are: inputfile name AND which node you want to find all the paths for
                                                                  AND flag 1 or 0. (1 will display immediate table for each iteration)

EXECUTABLE (after 'make')
    - mylinkstate

NOTE: The formatting gets messed up with large number of nodes
NOTE: I added a table that tells distance from any node to the source node
             It was not required, but I added it because it helped see the data
            if the formatting got messed up.
NOTE: Maximum number of nodes/vertices upto 500

TESTED LOCALLY ON MAC OS monterey 12.3 in Clion
TESTED ON CSEGRID (Ran without issues) just some formatting issues at larger numbers of nodes/vertices
